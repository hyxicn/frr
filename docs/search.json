Copies of the AAERs are obtained from the SEC website and the LexisNexis database. Each AAER is separately examined to identify whether it involves an alleged GAAP violation. In cases where a GAAP violation is involved, the reporting periods that were alleged to be misstated are identiﬁed.\nDechow et al. [2011, table 3] suggest four types of fraud determinants: (1) “accruals quality-related variables”: nine variables, which can be calculated from the numbers in annual ﬁnancial statements such as balance sheets and income statements; (2) “performance variables”: ﬁve variables that gauge a ﬁrm’s ﬁnancial performance on various dimensions; (3) two “nonﬁnancial variables” and four “off-balance-sheet variables,” which can be calculated using annual report disclosures; and (4) eight “market-related incentives” variables, which can be computed using either annual report disclosures, or stock price data, or both. We include all the variables under the category of “accruals quality-related variables” except for the four discretionary accrual measures (i.e., “modiﬁed jones discretionary accruals,” “performance-matched discretionary accruals,” “mean-adjusted absolute value of DD residuals,” and “studentized DD residuals”) because we wish to use variables that can be easily calculated from ﬁnancial statements.",
